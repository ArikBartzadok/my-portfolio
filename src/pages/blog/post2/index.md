If you are new to the world of programming, you may have heard of something called _'GitHub'_ and wondered what it really was.

It is very common for developers who are starting to integrate themselves in the world of technology to feel ashamed to ask questions because they think they may be asking something _'stupid'_, and it is precisely for this reason that I am writing this post.

**GitHub** is a source code hosting platform with version control using Git. It allows programmers, utilities or any user registered on the platform to contribute to the development of private and / or Open Source projects from anywhere in the world.

**GitHub** is widely used by programmers to publicize their work or for other programmers to contribute to the project, in addition to promoting easy communication through resources that report problems or merge remote repositories, which are called _issues_ and _pull request_.

##Is GitHub famous?

The answer is a big yes in a high and good tone, after all GitHub is used worldwide and has more than 36 million active users worldwide contributing to commercial or personal projects.

Today **GitHub** houses more than **100 million projects**, some of which are known worldwide. _WordPress_, _GNU / Linux_, _Atom_, _Electron_. **GitHub** also supports the organizing feature that is widely used by those who want a larger scale for their projects. Most of the time, the feature is used by existing companies like **Google**, **Microsoft** and **WordPress**.

In any opinion, the story of GitHub is incredible, and you can check it out officially on the **[Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/pt-br/v2/Come%C3%A7ando-Uma-Breve-Hist%C3%B3ria-do-Git)**
